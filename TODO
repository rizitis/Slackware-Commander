Write app from scratch, as gtkdialog no building any more.
Time needed to patch gtkdialog is the same for create a new Qt6 modern GUI...

slack-required is huge. I dont like so many deps must be half of them.
recheck everything for alternatives.

Check if slack-revert can you cptn batabase for packages or leave it alone...

cptn make-db -a maybe not needed now, as we have soofiles gui. check also.

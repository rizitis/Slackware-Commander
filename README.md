Start writting from scratch app in a modern but *KISS* Qt6 gui<br>

So for now **main** branch is in **RC** mode and rest branches EOL.<br>

IF you want to be a **tester** Please:
- Install requires from SBo/Ponce: `slpkg -i yq 
jq 
chafa 
figlet`
- clone repo `git clone https://github.com/rizitis/Slackware-Commander.git` or download [zip](https://github.com/rizitis/Slackware-Commander/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)<br> 
- cd to `scmd.SlackBuild` folder and command `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `sudo bash scmd.SlackBuild`
- Binary will be in /tmp as usual for installpkg

Please `man scmd` for details...<br>
